### Inspiration:
#### What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
#### Which hosts are the busiest and why?
    
### Project Description
#### In this project, I will perform a descriptive and exploratory analysis of the data, in order to understand how the phenomena of each variable behave individually and transversely, in addition to generate hypotheses useful for future decision-making. 

### Methods
#### To perform this, I will use statistical techniques very common in any type of analysis, simple or complex, such as classification of variables, frequency distribution tables, histograms, measures of central tendency and etc.

### Outline
#### 1. Libraries & Loading the data
#### A. Libraries Used
#### B. Loading the data
#### C. Summary of data
#### 2. Descriptive Analysis
####  In general descriptive analyzes are the first manipulations performed in a quantitative study and their main objective is to summarize and explore the behavior of the data using statistical techniques.
